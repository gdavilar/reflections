When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on another machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you can control when changes are made.  Rather than having a cluster of different updates

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is copying a repository in github
    Clone is copying from github to local, or local to local
    Branch is a history of commits.  you can add multiple branches to have different versions of the files
    Fork is quick copying in github and still showing the original user
    Clone is a way to get a copy of the repository so you can work on it without worrying of changing original
    Branches are a nice way to just add different features or versions of the original project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This allows you to work offline, say if you're going to be on a flight with no internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Saving versions or revisions of files and share those with others.
    They can see what was changed in the revision and approve or disapprove of the changes.
    This would be easier for small project or small groups, but it would be very 
    cumbersome with the larger projects and large groups.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
