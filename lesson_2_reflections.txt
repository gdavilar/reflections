What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This creates a hidden folder called .git
This allows git to do version control on the files in the repository (directory)

How is the staging area differet from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It is where recently changed files are placed, prior to them being commited.
This is good because it allows you to control what files are commited.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area allows me to see what files have changed and ensure I am only pushing the files I want to.
